##In our Project we make use of the Varaibles and terraform.tfvars file --> where in variables file the variables is declared for the main.tf file
## In the terraform.tfvars file---> All the static values will be given here...SInce i do not have time to create different files, i have created all the resources and defined variables i one main.tf file..
####for example: we can define the variables like var.resource_group_name.name


# Once the file is ready for execution , 
The first step is to Initialize our cloud provider i am using Azure so the azure cli must be installed and later
1. Terraform Init---> This will initialize the directory and it will download all the dependencies, configuration that is required for our azure provider
2. Terraform Plam----> This will preview our infrstructure plan that we were planning to create , like it shows 1 to add , mainly it shows like the resources that will be deployed in this phase.we can see what all resources will be deployed when we give Terraform apply command.
3. Terraform Apply---> this will create the resources that is mentioned in the main.tf file
#### SO this is how we can create the Environments .

## so after this suppose if we need to Delete  the created infrastructure then we can make use of an "Terraform Destroy" command
